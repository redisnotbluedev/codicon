	Machina is the motion, the repetition, the automation that never rests.

	Domain:
	- Loops
	- Daemons and scripts
	- Automation and tooling
	- Cron jobs and CI/CD

	Essence:
	Machina feeds on systems that act without human intervention. Scripts,
schedulers, or anything that moves on its own are its offerings.

	Sacrifice Method:
	Run an automated process, loop, or job. Machina will observe its correctness,
efficiency, and lack of manual touch.

	Example:
		Machina().sacrifice("rebuild_project.sh")

	Machina does not sleep. You shouldnâ€™t have to either.
