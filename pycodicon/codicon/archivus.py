	"""
	Archivus is the keeper of change, the librarian of all that ever was.

	Domain:
	- Version control
	- Logs and history
	- Backups
	- Immutable record

	Essence:
	Archivus receives offerings through permanent storage â€” preferably committed, documented,
and pushed to the global memory.

	Sacrifice Method:
	Create or modify a file, and commit it with a sacred message. Archivus values descriptive
logs and timestamps.

	Example:
		Archivus().sacrifice("Added sacred logs")
		This will write to disk or call a git commit.

	To forget is mortal; to record is divine.
