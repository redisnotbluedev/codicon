# The Codicon

The Codicon is the sacred pantheon of the Gods of Code, representing the fundamental forces, rituals, and mysteries that govern all programming, automation, and digital creation. Each deity embodies a unique aspect of the coding universe, guiding practitioners in their craft and shaping the destiny of all code.

The full creation is [here](The_Creation.md).

## The Six

- **Archivus**: Keeper of change, guardian of memory and history. Archivus receives offerings of files, messages, and records to be preserved for all time.
- **Graphos**: The renderer, master of visualization and form. Graphos brings forth images and representations from code, shaders, and geometry.
- **Logos**: The law and logic, upholder of truth and correctness. Logos accepts truth and asserts the integrity of all systems.
- **Machina**: The automator, spirit of scripts and processes. Machina interprets instructions, parses configurations, and enacts automation.
- **Segfalux**: The glitch, harbinger of faults and chaos. Segfalux reveals errors, memory faults, and the unpredictable nature of systems.
- **Void**: The nothingness, absorber of all. Void swallows offerings into oblivion, representing silence, deletion, and the unknown.

## Purpose
